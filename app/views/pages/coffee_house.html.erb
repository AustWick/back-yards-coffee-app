  <h2>About the Coffee House</h2>

  <h5>Chicago's Community Roasters</h5>
  <p>Back of the Yards Coffee Co. is a specialty coffee roaster located in Chicago's Back of the Yards community that not only produces great tasting coffee, but that also makes a direct social and economic impact in the community. We've established direct relationships with coffee growers in Chiapas, Mexico which allows for coffee growers to keep more revenue while allowing us to offer high quality specialty coffee in our neighborhood.</p>
  <h5>We are now open!</h5>
