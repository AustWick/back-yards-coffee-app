      <h2>Our Origin</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Our story began with two Back of the Yards residents and longtime friends, Mayra Hernandez and Jesse IÃ±iguez, experimenting with making coffee, and it wasn't long before they began dreaming about turning that passion into a business.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thanks to community support, Jesse and Mayra were able to raise $16,000 to start their own roastery. Since the coffeehouse at 2059 W 47th Street opened in early 2017, business has been booming, which is a testament to Mayra and Jesse's dedication to brewing, serving and selling GREAT tasting coffee. </p>

      <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Life is too short to drink bad coffee. Our coffee is selected from the finest beans available from around the world and sourced in a socially and environmentally responsible way.</p>
      <br> 
      <p>We've established direct relationships with coffee growers in Chiapas, Mexico. This provides additional revenue while allowing us to offer high quality specialty coffee in our neighborhood at a reasonable price.</p>

      <h2>Our Sustainability</h2>
      <br>
      <p>We are a company dedicated to reduce the impact of wastes generated in our store by offering reusable cups and by composting other waste.</p>
      <br> 
      <p>In addition, we source as many of our products as possible from around the neighborhood and sell baked goods in our coffeehouse made from locally-grown ingredients.</p>

      <h2>Our Neighborhood</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Above all else, Mayra and Jesse hope to change the narrative of a neighborhood negatively associated with gang violence. To work toward this, they developed a social impact fund which donates $1 of every bag of coffee sold toward scholarships and funding for young people in Back of the Yards.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The social impact fund is meant to fund youth programs, education and scholarships as well as encouraging peace within the community.</p>
